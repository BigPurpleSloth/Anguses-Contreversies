					<h2>Controversy 1: Dylan</h2>
					<p>Angus makes a funny meme, that says Dylan likes men, but Dylan didn't think it was very funny and told his parents.</p>
					<p>This guy is dumb, but it wasn't completely his fault for the meme getting out, but Dylan absolutely messed up for telling his parents.</p>

				<section id="controversy2">
					<h2>Controversy 2: Jethro</h2>
					<p>Angus decks Jethro in maths, reason unknown, but definitely believable.</p>
					<p>Angus has anger issues but there wasn't much controversy here they both just got pissed with each other.</p>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="box3">
				<section id="controversy3">
					<h2>Controversy 3: Stuart</h2>
					<p>Angus manages to diss Stuart's dead dog because Stuart dissed Angus's rents, Stuart then squirts Angus's lipton and George claps him.</p>
					<p>Major overreaction from Stuart who I thought was mentally strong until this one, but Angus also mega dumb for saying that.</p>
